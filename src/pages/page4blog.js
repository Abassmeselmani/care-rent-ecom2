                <p className="pageContent_parag">When renting a car, you can choose to pick it up at the airport or in the city, each option having its pros and cons. Picking up a car at the airport is convenient, especially after a long flight, saving time and hassle with immediate access to transportation. However, airport rentals often come with higher fees and taxes. On the other hand, renting from a city location can be more affordable, with a wider selection of vehicles and fewer additional charges. If you donâ€™t need a car immediately upon arrival, opting for a city pickup could save
                     money while still offering flexibility during your trip.</p>
